<h3 id="what-tips-would-you-give-to-a-budding-programmer">What tips would you give to a budding programmer?</h3>

<p>Programming can be fun, but it is not all fun and games, Our civiliztion depends on good software.</p>

<p>Whatever you are interested in, there will be a use for programming: literature, automobile production, history, coffee making, wind and solar energy, movie making, rocket science, farm management, medicine, science, engineering, and so much more.</p>

<p>You might eventually be able to make a significant contribution to whatever field you find important or interesting! To do that youâ€™ll have to know the field and the tools and techniques of software development. Be sure you learn fundamentals, such as data structures and how machines work.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t get overwhelmed, and donâ€™t think you will be an expert in just a few weeks. Think of how long it takes to learn to speak a natural language, how long it takes to become a good athlete, and how long it takes to learn to play an instrument well enough for someone who isnâ€™t your mother to want to listen to.</p>

<p>Think about how much fun you can have along the way to reach such mastery and how many friends you might make along the way. Some of the nicest people work with software.</p>
