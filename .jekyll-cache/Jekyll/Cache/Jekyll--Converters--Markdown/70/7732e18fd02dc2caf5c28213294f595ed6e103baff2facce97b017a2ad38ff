<p>In many single-user environments, the filesystem root directory starts off being mounted read-only. If <strong>/etc</strong> is part of the root filesystem(the usual case), it will be impossible to edit many important configuration files. To fix this problem, youâ€™ll have to begin your single-user session by remounting <strong>/</strong> in read/write mode. Under Linux, the command</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge"># mount -o rw,remount /</code></p>

<p>usually does the trick.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong>
You can run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fsck</code> command on unmounted filesystems only. For most filesystems, you can just unmount the filesystem to check it and then remount it when youâ€™re finished. However, because the root filesystem contains all the core Linux commands and log files, you canâ€™t unmount it on a running system.</p>
